You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry the checkout with 'git checkout -f HEAD'

# This command only applies `longpaths` to the current project
$ git config core.longpaths true
$ git checkout -f HEAD

## Note

With the above change, some of the scripts might fail. That's the reason for `core.longpaths` not enabled by default.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Starting in Windows 10, version 1607, MAX_PATH limitations have been removed from common Win32 file and directory functions. However, you must opt-in to the new [behaviour](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/naming-a-file).
