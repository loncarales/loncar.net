I've found Yashica T5 in one of the forgotten drawers at home, and it's still working!

Among the compact cameras, all Yashica models (T2, T3, T4, T5) are remarkable. Yashica T5 is a high-quality camera with the first-class craftsmanship and high-quality, bright Tessar lens from Carl Zeiss. This camera is practically the pop star among cameras. This baby has probably the better optics than your average DSLR kit you have at home. From the outside, the camera looks more like a cheap plastic camera from the past, but it has a Carl Zeiss Tessar 35mm f/3.5 lens with four elements in 3 groups, which was often called an "eagle eye" due to its extraordinary imaging performance. 
The Zeiss lens is incredibly powerful and reproduces the respective motifs almost distortion-free. Very well preserved Yashica T5 cameras are now achieving "cult status" and high prices (between 400 - 500 EUR) on the second-hand market.

I took below photos at Guča Trumpet Festival in 2005.
