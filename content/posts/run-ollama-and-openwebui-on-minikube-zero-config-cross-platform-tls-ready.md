Running large language models (LLMs) locally has never been easier. What if I told you that you could deploy a complete AI stack with Ollama and OpenWebUI on Kubernetes with just **one command**? There are no complex configurations or manual setup steps - just pure automation.

This project lets you deploy [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and [OpenWebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/) on [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) with a single command. It works on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows[^1]**, with or without GPU[^2] support, and includes:

[^1]: I did not test the scripts on Windows. They should work out of the box once all prerequisites are installed.
[^2]: [Using NVIDIA GPUs with minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/nvidia/) is only supported on Linux.

- üîê HTTPS via mkcert and cert-manager
- üß† Internal LLM inference via Ollama
- üñ•Ô∏è Beautiful web UI via OpenWebUI
- ‚öôÔ∏è Optional GPU acceleration with CUDA/NVIDIA (only on Linux)
- üì¶ Fully scripted deployment with a `Makefile`

## üí° Why Run LLMs Locally?

Before diving into the technical details, let's talk about why you'd want to run AI models locally instead of using cloud services:

- ‚úÖ **Privacy & Control**: Your sensitive data never leaves your machine. This is crucial for businesses handling confidential information or developers working on proprietary projects.
- ‚úÖ **Zero subscription fees**: No monthly subscription fees or pay-per-token costs. Once you have the hardware, your AI inference is free.
- ‚úÖ  **Performance**: Lower latency compared to API calls to cloud services, significant for real-time applications.
- ‚úÖ **Customization**: Full control over model selection, fine-tuning, and configuration without platform limitations.
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- ‚úÖ **GPU Optional**: Automatically detects GPU availability and falls back to CPU-only mode when needed.
- ‚úÖ **Learning**: Perfect for understanding how AI systems work under the hood and experimenting with different models.

### The Challenge with Local AI Deployment

- Setting up a local AI stack traditionally involves multiple steps:
- Configuring GPU drivers and CUDA (if available)
- Setting up container runtimes
- Managing networking and ingress
- Handling SSL certificates
- Coordinating multiple services
- Platform-specific configurations

This complexity often deters developers from experimenting with local AI deployments. That's precisely the problem I wanted to solve.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Cross-Platform and GPU-Optional

When I first created this project, it was primarily focused on Linux systems with NVIDIA GPUs. However, I've evolved the solution to be more universal:

- **Cross-Platform Support**: The deployment now works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The automation detects the platform and configures everything accordingly.
- **NVIDIA GPU Detection**: Don't have a GPU? No problem! The system automatically detects NVIDIA GPU[^2] availability in the Minikube and gracefully falls back to CPU-only mode. This means you can run AI models on any modern machine, from high-end workstations to modest laptops.
- **Intelligent Configuration**: The Makefile and deployment scripts now include detection logic that adapts to your specific environment, eliminating the need for manual configuration changes.

## üöÄ Introducing Zero-Config LLM Deployment

My solution provides a **single command** that handles everything automatically:

```bash
make
```

That's it. This one command:

- Starts Minikube with GPU support (if available)
- Configures ingress and networking
- Sets up SSL certificates
- Deploys Ollama for model serving
- Deploys OpenWebUI for the web interface
- Verifies the installation

### What You Get Out of the Box

The deployment includes:

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.ai/): A powerful tool for running LLMs locally with GPU acceleration support. It handles model management and inference, providing a clean API.
- [**OpenWebUI**](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/): A beautiful, ChatGPT-like web interface that connects to Ollama. It offers features such as conversation history, model switching, and file uploads.
- **Kubernetes Infrastructure**: Everything runs on [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/), giving you an environment that's easy to manage and scale.
- **Security**: Automatic TLS certificate generation using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for secure HTTPS connections.
- **Networking**: Proper ingress configuration with a clever DNS solution using [traefik.me](https://traefik.me/) for automatic hostname resolution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start Guide

Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

You'll need these core tools installed:

- Minikube
- kubectl
- Helm
- mkcert

Optional on Linux for GPU acceleration (automatically detected):

- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- CUDA Toolkit and drivers

The beauty of the updated solution is that it works regardless of whether you have a high-end GPU setup or a regular laptop. The system detects your capabilities and configures itself accordingly.

### One-Command Deployment

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loncarales/minikube-ollama-lab.git
cd minikube-ollama-lab
make
```

### Accessing Your AI Stack

Once deployed, open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
# On Linux: When Minikube IP is 192.168.49.2
https://openwebui-192-168-49-2.traefik.me

# On macOS and Windows via
# minikube tunnel (must be running in a shell)
https://openwebui-127-0-0-1.traefik.me
```

The hostname automatically resolves to your configured IP using the free traefik.me wildcard DNS service ‚Äì no `/etc/hosts` editing required!

## üîå Technical Deep Dive

### GPU Acceleration (When Available)

The setup includes GPU detection and configuration. If you have compatible NVIDIA hardware, it automatically configures GPU passthrough for containers, enabling faster model inference. If not, it seamlessly falls back to CPU-only mode.

You can verify GPU access (if available) with:

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n ollama $(kubectl get pods -n ollama -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ollama -o name) -- nvidia-smi
```

Run a quick inference:

```bash
# Pull a CUDA-compatible model
kubectl exec -it -n ollama $(kubectl get pods -n ollama -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ollama -o name) -- ollama pull llama2

# Run a simple inference to test GPU acceleration
kubectl exec -it -n ollama $(kubectl get pods -n ollama -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ollama -o name) -- bash -c 'echo "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" | ollama run llama2'
```

Monitor GPU usage live (if available) with:

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run:
kubectl exec -it -n ollama $(kubectl get pods -n ollama -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ollama -o name) -- watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi
```

For CPU-only deployments, the models will still run efficiently, just with longer inference times.

### Customization Options

You can customize the deployment with environment variables:

```bash
# Example with custom resource allocation
MINIKUBE_MEMORY=8192m MINIKUBE_CPUS=2 make
```

## üåç Real-World Usage Scenarios

This setup is perfect for:

- **Development & Testing**: Quickly spin up AI environments for testing applications that integrate with LLMs, regardless of your hardware setup.
- **Learning & Experimentation**: Try different models and configurations without incurring cloud costs, making it perfect for students and researchers with varying hardware capabilities.
- **Private AI Applications**: Build applications that require data privacy and don't want to rely on external APIs, accessible to developers across different platforms.
- **Prototyping**: Rapid prototyping of AI-powered features before moving to production, lowering the barrier to entry.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Develop AI applications that work consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
- **Research**: Academic research requiring control over the AI inference pipeline is now accessible to researchers without specialized hardware.

## üèéÔ∏è Performance Considerations

To get the best performance:

- Allocate sufficient memory (16GB+ recommended, but 8GB works for smaller models)
- Use multiple CPU cores (4+ recommended)
- If available, ensure your GPU has adequate VRAM for your chosen models
- Consider NVMe storage for faster model loading
- For CPU-only setups, choose models appropriate for your available RAM

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting Common Issues

The project includes comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, but here are the most common issues:

- **Pods Stuck in Pending**: Usually indicates insufficient resources. Increase Minikube's memory and CPU allocation.
- **GPU Not Detected**: Only relevant if you expected GPU acceleration. Verify NVIDIA Container Toolkit installation and Docker runtime configuration. Remember, CPU-only mode is perfectly functional for most use cases.
- **Ingress Issues**: Check that the ingress controller is running and verify your Minikube IP address (on Linux).
