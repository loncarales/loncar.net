I am mostly posting pictures of food on Social Media, but I am not a chef. In my daytime, I am brewing code. Although I am in my early 40's, I still love to grasp for new knowledge and technology. I've added a new programming language to the stack I've been using so far: Java, PHP, Javascript, Perl, Python, C#, C/C++, Pascal, Oberon ...

I've looked into [Go](https://golang.org) (golang) and I fall in love. Go is a statically typed, concurrent, compiled programming language that was created with the aim of managing programming issues that large organisations face with on a day-to-day basis. Go is scalable to large systems. I am not a pro in Go yet. I am currently using it on a day to day basis to automate development processes which were formerly written in Perl scripts.
I've also mastered [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) (ala Infrastructure as Code). I've strengthened my knowledge of Containers ([Docker](https://www.docker.com), rkt) and started to learn and use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
I've read many technical and non-technical books this year. I do a massive amount of walking every day (with our dog) and I this is a great time to absorb audio especially Podcasts. My favourites are [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime), [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) and [PodCTL](https://blog.openshift.com/). I've enrolled and finished a dozen MOOCs on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), [edX](https://www.edx.org), [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com) ... mostly in topics of Cloud Computing, Blockchain, Containers, Microservices, etc. I am currently learning the fundamentals of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift and Big Data.

For 2018 I don't have any particular main goal. For a start, I've updated my [**Site**](https://www.loncar.net) page and updated my Resume which is now available [**online**](https://resume.loncar.net). I am going to go with the flow. I want to learn Apache [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) and probably [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) as a new programming language.
