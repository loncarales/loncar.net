Never give up on your dreams. If you give up on your dreams, you’re living a life unfulfilled. I can’t imagine not being passionate about something.  I've decided to share my passion for cooking and baking by honouring music legends while creating food memories. No regular blog, no monologues, no bullshit just pure rock'n'roll and food porn. Before I can begin, I need to buy some necessary equipment to start with: speakers for the kitchen, at least two action cameras and some light bulbs for better filming. The fame name I've already chosen **"MotorChef"**. Let the journey begin. 

Live life with purpose, and you will never be bored.
