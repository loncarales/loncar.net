As a software engineer, I have a very agile mindset, at least at work. When regarding my private life, I am more conservative, cautious and meticulously. A lot of my pet projects are still lying around, waiting to be finished.
 
"When is a Project finished?"  I could only sum up all the tasks that still need to be done, and it looks endlessly.  So the right answer would be, a project is never finished. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Recent events in my life changed my way to perceive some things.  My mind and thinking have opened in a whole new way. I've decided that I'll be taking more advantage of every opportunity in my life.

This is me being curious, saying yes, not hesitating, taking more risks.  I'll present you "unfinished" project with a name "Homemade is tasty". After work, the playground is my kitchen. It' s just a beginning, and hopefully, soon I'll find a place where I could organise the culinary events. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ‘Œ

That's not all ðŸ˜‰ Farcical alter ego "Motorchef" is already in the making. Mostly I am going to share the music I am listening to while cooking ... so stayed tuned. ðŸŽ¸
