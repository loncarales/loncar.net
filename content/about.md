With a strong technical background and two decades of experience spanning various client, server and cloud infrastructure technologies. I'm a Developer in the heart with DevOps in mind. I always leave code and processes in better shape than when I first encountered them (Boy Scout Rule). Proactive problem solver. A team player and passionate about working with talented teammates. I like to learn, experiment and utilise new technologies, concepts and procedures as appropriate to project requirements. I embrace Cloud Native, and I like to build software in a “You build it, you run it” manner.


> Uncle Bob in Clean Code states, "the Boy Scout Rule tells us we should leave the code cleaner than we found it." Another words, when we make changes to the code base, we should make sure we are leaving it (checking in to repository) cleaner.
